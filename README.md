# PR-DC Arduino Library for Analog Devices AD7193 

The AD7193 is a low noise, complete analog front end for high precision 
measurement applications. It contains a low noise, 24-bit sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) 
analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The on-chip low noise gain stage means 
that signals of small amplitude can interface directly to the ADC. 
The device can be configured to have four differential inputs.
